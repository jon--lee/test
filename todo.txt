//create functionality that checks if the link already exists
//get the code from the server not the client side (security risk)
when making the size of the canvas, make it so that the client with the larger one is dominant
when the client changes hte size of the window, update the canvas sizes of both clients

video should have minimize, hang up, mute, pause
later on add functionality for just audio --- a way to do this would be to hang-up then call again with dif constraints (ie just audio)
give a popup about the basics of the site. make sure the iphone usage is the most prominant part (with an image)
make a button for just images --- load image, use webcam use iphone



when doing the heroku thing, make sure the indexOf modules in socket.io (and elsewhere) are not ignored in the git ignore file
also make sure that the server port is set to heroku's instead of local's ie 
http.listen(process.env.PORT ||3000, function(){
    //console.log('listening on *:3000');
});

also when creating the link for the video chat, the "/" at the end of the link matters. build functionality so that people will either end up on the same place, or the link won't matter (check main.js in the session folder for the room names and namespaces


once officially decided, scale down the image for high speed loading
for now, let js work after dom loads not content
for deployment replace "$( window ).load(function(){" with "$(document).ready(function(){"
