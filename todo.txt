//create functionality that checks if the link already exists
//get the code from the server not the client side (security risk)
when making the size of the canvas, make it so that the client with the larger one is dominant
when the client changes hte size of the window, update the canvas sizes of both clients

video should have minimize, hang up, mute, pause
later on add functionality for just audio --- a way to do this would be to hang-up then call again with dif constraints (ie just audio)
give a popup about the basics of the site. make sure the iphone usage is the most prominant part (with an image)
1. share the link (add text box with copy-to-clipboard button)
2. allow video (add picture)
3. Draw with an iOS device (add picture)
add "Got it!" button at the bottom


make a button for just images --- load image, use webcam use iphone



when doing the heroku thing, make sure the indexOf modules in socket.io (and elsewhere) are not ignored in the git ignore file
also make sure that the server port is set to heroku's instead of local's ie 
http.listen(process.env.PORT ||3000, function(){
    //console.log('listening on *:3000');
});

also when creating the link for the video chat, the "/" at the end of the link matters. build functionality so that people will either end up on the same place, or the link won't matter (check main.js in the session folder for the room names and namespaces


once officially decided, scale down the image for high speed loading
for now, let js work after dom loads not content
for deployment replace "$( window ).load(function(){" with "$(document).ready(function(){"








Things to do:
//- make the cursor for all draggable things (open hand and close hand)
- make the buttons for video option (rest can be done on photoshop for icons)
        - crossed out microphone
    //    - x-out button
    //    - minimize button
//- make an "open video" div and button so that when its closed, you can open it again
  //  - if the streaming is not happenign, this will call getUserMedia
- make the changes occur for the remote user as well

- make chat box
    - make open button div (closed on document load)
    - opens chat at bottom of page
    - 
- make video buttons better looking (responsive to clicks)
- if the user has denied user media, and then clicks the video button, make a drop down that asks the user to configure their settings as simply refreshing does not work

- make it so that when a user joins but the room is full, it deconstructs.
//- overlay paused video with a dark transparency

- make strict variable definitions for the line type and width for drawing to be passed to peer





************LONG TERM******************

allow multiple users to join the chat
